    <h1 id="reading">Expanded Preface</h1>

    <p>In launching this project to document my weekly waste, I embarked on what initially seemed a modest experiment. It was driven by a simple yet probing question: What could the daily items I no longer found use for tell me about my own habits and, by extension, the cultural and ecological imprints of those habits? This quest was not just an inward gaze but also a mirror reflecting the broader societal patterns of consumption and disposal.</p>
	
	<h2>Digging Deeper</h2>
	
	<p>This endeavor ventured beyond the typical narratives of food waste— a<a href="https://nurturenaturecenter.org/community-in-action/learn-by-doing-tracking-household-waste/" target="_blank"> prevalent topic</a> in environmental discourse—and instead focused on the miscellany of everyday life: the broken gadgets, the spent batteries, the outmoded fashion accessories. These objects, often relegated to the periphery of our attention, now took center stage. Each week, as I chronicled these items, a pattern emerged, painting a vivid picture of my personal consumption habits while simultaneously shedding light on the larger cultural and historical implications.
	Anne Berg's reflective work on how <a href="https://allegralaboratory.net/heritage-out-of-control-dont-trash-my-holocaust/" target="_blank"> the remnants of the past shape our understanding of history</a> resonated with my project's ethos. Her analysis of how materials left behind at Holocaust memorials can tell us much about our history provided a profound underpinning to my endeavor. It suggested that my own waste, too, carried the weight of history and begged for deeper ecological contemplation.</p>
	
	
	<p>The project became a canvas, revealing the frequency of my purchases, the lifespan of my possessions, and my participation in the throwaway culture that characterizes much of modern living. Sharing this journey online added a collective dimension, transforming the project from a personal chronicle into a communal one. Each post became a conversation starter, a point of connection with others grappling with the implications of our shared consumption practices.</p>
	
	<h2>Tales of the Trash Can</h2>

	<p>Inspired by the <a href="https://medium.com/history-made-by-us/trash-or-treasure-what-gets-saved-might-get-remembered-dcc9a4b3e9ad" target="_blank">collective archiving</a> of Made By Us, this project embraced the notion that documenting the present is crucial for future understanding. The collective memory of our time is being shaped right now, and by participating in this digital archive, I contribute to the patchwork that will be used to decode our era. Brian Thill’s considerations on discarded items as carriers of narrative and culture became a guiding principle for this project. Thill suggests that waste signifies more than an object's end—it symbolizes our changing relationships with materiality (Thill 29). This perspective encouraged me to see each item of waste not just as trash but as a testament to personal and societal narratives.</p>

	<p><a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/archaeologist-talks-trash" target="_blank">Sarah Newman's</a> insights into the value of what is left behind influenced my project as well. Just as archaeologists interpret the past through the material culture that survives, this project posits that our future histories may be read in the refuse we leave behind. The objects I discarded weekly were not just personal relics but potential cultural artifacts, each telling a story about the world in which they were used and disposed of.</p>
	
	<p>Ian Bogost's ‘<a href="https://academic.oup.com/minnesota-scholarship-online/book/29364/chapter-abstract/244307336?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank">ontography</a>’ brought an analytical lens to the project, encouraging the cataloging of waste to highlight the separateness and uniqueness of each object. Bogost's method, which focuses on listing to underscore the disjunction between things, helped frame my waste documentation not as a cohesive narrative but as a collection of independent entities. This methodological approach reinforced the idea that every piece of trash has its own history and place within the larger ecological system.</p>
	
	<p>Each entry in this waste catalog is a mosaic piece of our contemporary existence, reflecting the interplay between utility and waste, desire and discard. As Berg's work suggests, the items we cast aside are not merely personal refuse but historical artifacts that bear witness to the ecological narratives we are scripting. They are relics of our time, pointing to a future archaeological excavation that Newman might one day undertake, revealing the layers of our present-day civilization through the lens of what we deemed disposable. This project, then, is an ongoing synthesis, weaving together the threads of personal habit, cultural practice, and ecological impact into a tapestry rich with the imprints of our time.</p>

	<p>The project is an exploration of personal patterns within the context of larger cultural and ecological narratives. It is a journal, capturing the evolution of my consumption habits. It is also a museum, housing a collection of modern detritus, each object offering insight into the historical moment of its creation and disposal. It is as much an exploration of self as it is a dialogue with my culture and an inquiry into the ecological footprint we are collectively creating.</p>
	
	<p>Through this online archive, the project is positioned as an intersection of personal reflection and public discourse. It serves as an acknowledgment of the intricate dance between the individual and the collective, between the private act of consumption and its public environmental repercussions. In documenting the seemingly inconsequential, the project aims to provoke thought, inspire change, and contribute to the narrative tapestry from which future generations will learn about us, our time, and the world we shaped—one piece of discarded waste at a time.</p>
