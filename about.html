	<p>Hi there! My name is Aanand Aggarwal, and I'm a junior at Rutgers studying CS and ITI. I currently live on campus
        here and hope to live in/near
        NYC after graduation. I like to watch TV, mainly going through anime that I've been meaning to watch like Hunter
        x Hunter. I also like to play games on my Switch and make music.</p>


	
    <p>With this project, I hope to build a strong multimedia web project and build my skills in web authoring, design,
        and development while archiving my life through waste. In the future, I think I'd like to center my web-based
        project around my interests, and I'd like to experiment with something related to music, video games, football,
        etc.</p>
